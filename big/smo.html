     <p>As of January 2021, there are 4.2 billion unique users of social media worldwide. (1) Social media has become a fixture of modern life, becoming the way that the vast majority of people interact online. People use it to stay in touch with loved ones, stream content, get their news, and increasingly, make decisions as to how they buy products and services. Modern social media is an interconnected web of a variety of different platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube, to name a few. For years, companies have utilized Search Engine Optimization (SEO) as a way to drive internet users to their site. Everyone wants to be at the top of that page of google search results. Search engines have increasingly begun to use recommendations of users on major social media platforms as a way to rank pages in search engine results. The more popular a page is on social media platforms, the closer to the top it appears in search results.  This has led to the rise of Social Media Optimization (SMO).
     </p>

     <p>The term SMO was first coined by Rohit Bhargava on his blog in 2006 and initially consisted of five rules. The five have since been expanded out to sixteen rules. The five rules consist of: increase your linkability, make tagging and bookmarking easy, reward inbound links, help your content travel, and encouraging the mashup. Encouraging the mashup basically means to encourage people to engage with your content by integrating it into their social media in the form of embedded content. (Bhargava) Social Media Optimization is related to SEO in that its purpose is to drive traffic to a company’s page, except SMO is different in that it doesn’t do so through search engines. Instead it does so through the more organic method of social media interactions. SMO is all about applying what makes for a successful social media presence (connection, authenticity, ease of sharing posts) and applying that to a company’s brand. So brands will tailor their social media presence to a particular platform, A clothing manufacturer will find InstaGram influencers to model its clothes on their own IG pages, and also provide easy links that take the viewer to the page for that clothing manufacturer. The same holds true for Pinterest, and other “eye candy” type social media platforms. Companies have social media managers who are good at Twitter manage their Twitter accounts. 
     </p>
    
     <p>SMO via Twitter is more about using clever writing, clapbacks, and humor to create an experience that feels authentic. A notable success has been the Twitter account for Steak-umm. Nathan Allebach, the social media manager for Steak-umm, uses marketing techniques such as humor, shock, and being cleverly anti consumerist to help create what feels like an authentic social media experience. “People joke that the account is ‘one of Twitter’s therapists,’ Allebach says, the frozen meat brand you go to for ‘life advice,’ or ‘just to vent.’ It’s not going to fix anything — it is, in its own words ‘a frozen meat company on Twitter’ — but, you know, it hears you. The tweets don’t inspire cravings; they inspire identification.” (Sugar)
