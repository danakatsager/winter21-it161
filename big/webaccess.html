     <p>The web has become a major part of everyday life for many Americans. It is estimated that in the United States in 2020, 86% of the population were internet users. (Johnson) The internet has become an even more important facet of everyday life since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and social distancing, becoming a lifeline for many. This is especially true for the more than 61 million Americans who live with some type of disability. (2) Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 guarantees equal access to “places of public accommodation,” which also includes the internet. Currently there are no complete regulatory requirements to determine just what exactly constitutes equal access. However, the US Department of Justice has stated, “The fact that the regulatory process is not yet complete in no way indicates that web services are not already covered by title III." (3) Which means that along with the increase in internet usage has been an increase in lawsuits on the behalf of disabled Americans against companies with a web presence.</p>

     <p>As web developers and designers, our job is to help facilitate communication via the internet. So in the interests of building a connected, diverse, democratic society, we need to ensure that the greatest number of people possible can access the internet. More relevant to the interests of companies, designing sites accessible to the disabled helps shield companies from litigation. Since regulatory requirements are currently incomplete but companies are still vulnerable to litigation, developers have to take the initiative in making websites accessible to the disabled. On a more positive note, having a web presence that is easily accessible to disabled users increases the amount of consumers that a company can attract. A significant portion of the population has some form of disability, and they need to purchase products and services, too. Taking steps to facilitate that will also help the public perception of a company, which is vital in such a highly connected society.</p> 

     <p>Increasingly, the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) WCAG 2.1 standards are being embraced as the gold standard for determining whether a website complies with Title III. WCAG standards are technology independent and are organized around the four principles of being Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. Basically what this boils down to is that disabled users must be able to perceive content, be able to interact with and navigate through it, understand it, be able to do so with a variety of different user agents, and continue to be able to as technology advances. WCAG 2.1 gives the developer a lot of freedom in how exactly they go about this, with the criteria being that the content receives a AA rating after a manual audit performed by somebody familiar with the WCAG standards. (4)  WCAG is always being updated and revised, so keeping abreast of changes is advised. Through designing web content with the WCAG standards in mind, periodic audits by people familiar with the standards, and consultation with the disability community, companies and developers can be confident that their content is including everybody.</p>
